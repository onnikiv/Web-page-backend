# Web Page Backend

This project is part of the `wsk-web-development` course. The goal is to create a functional backend server that supports a web application fetching and displaying weekly and daily menus from various student restaurants. The backend is designed to handle data inconsistencies and errors gracefully while providing a robust API for the frontend.

## ‚≠ê Deployment and Server Information

The backend server for this project is accessible at [http://10.120.32.69/web-page](http://10.120.32.69/web-page). Note that the server does not have SSL authentication, so accessing it may require bypassing browser security warnings (e.g., using `thisisunsafe` in Chrome).

**Note:** The server does not have SSL authentication, so accessing it may require bypassing browser security warnings (e.g., using `thisisunsafe` in Chrome).
